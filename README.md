## What is Starcraft 2?

[StarCraft 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Legacy_of_the_Void)
is a [Real Time Strategy
(RTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy) game written by
[Blizzard](http://blizzard.com/). It's the successor to [StarCraft
Broodwar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft:_Brood_War), which is still itself even a somewhat popular RTS game. StarCraft II is played by millions of people, and
has a [professional league](https://wcs.starcraft2.com/en-us/).

The [goal in StarCraft](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/game/guide/whats-sc2) is to
build a base, manage an economy, build an army, and destroy your enemies. You
control your base and army from a third person perspective, then multi-task and
micro-manage your units for maximum effect. StarCraft has 3 distinct races:
[Terran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fmu8PsUDDtQ),
[Protoss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0g0MpllFCs) and
[Zerg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq74R7wWAnQ), which have different units
and strategies.

The game has a single player campaign, though most people play multiplayer on
[Battle.net](http://battle.net/sc2/en/). There are built-in bots, but they are
fairly weak and predictable, and the stronger ones cheat.

There are many resources online for learning about Starcraft, including
[Battle.net](http://battle.net/sc2/en/),
[Liquipedia](http://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/StarCraft) and
[Wikia](http://starcraft.wikia.com/). For map making check out
